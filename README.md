# Age Detection ML Project

An advanced machine learning project for detecting age groups from facial images. This repository includes:
- Data ingestion and augmentation pipelines.
- Dual-branch feature extraction (PCA and transfer learning).
- Model training with hyperparameter tuning.
- Deployment via GitLab Pages.

# Project Scope: Age Detection ML Project

## Problem Statement
Predict age groups (18–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60) from facial images.

## Objectives
- Create robust ETL pipelines for image data.
- Implement innovative data augmentation.
- Extract features using both PCA and transfer learning.
- Train and optimize a classifier.
- Showcase the project with an interactive GitLab Pages website.

## Deliverables
- Clean, modular Python code.
- Detailed documentation and notebooks.
- A deployable static website.
- A saved final model artifact.

## Tools & Libraries
Python 3, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Git, GitLab CI/CD.
